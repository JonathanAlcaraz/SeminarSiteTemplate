        <h3>Naturally Transforming for the Greater Good</h3>
        <p class="author">Eleanor Shellstrop</p>
        <p class="abstract">A natural transformation is a relation between two functors. Functors often describe "natural constructions" and natural transformations then describe "natural homomorphisms" between two such constructions. Sometimes two quite different constructions yield "the same" result; this is expressed by a natural isomorphism between the two functors. If F and G are (covariant) functors between the categories C and D, then a natural transformation η from F to G associates to every object X in C a morphism ηX : F(X) → G(X) in D such that for every morphism f : X → Y in C, we have ηY ∘ F(f) = G(f) ∘ ηX; this means that the following diagram is commutative:</p>

        <h3>The Morals of Mapping Class Groups</h3>
        <p class="author">Chidi Anagonye</p>
        <p class="abstract">Mapping class groups of 3-manifolds have received considerable study as well, and are closely related to mapping class groups of 2-manifolds.  For example, any finite group can be realized as the mapping class group (and also the isometry group) of a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold. Given a pair of spaces (X,A) the mapping class group of the pair is the isotopy-classes of automorphisms of the pair, where an automorphism of (X,A) is defined as an automorphism of X that preserves A, i.e. f: X → X is invertible and f(A) = A.</p>

        <h3>Generalizing Fourier Transforms</h3>
        <p class="author">Tahani Al-Jamil</p>
        <p class="abstract">The generalization of the Fourier transform to the noncommutative situation has also in part contributed to the development of noncommutative geometry. In this context, a categorical generalization of the Fourier transform to noncommutative groups is Tannaka–Krein duality, which replaces the group of characters with the category of representations. However, this loses the connection with harmonic functions.</p>

        <h3>Introduction to Elementary Algebra</h3>
        <p class="author">Jason Mendoza</p>
        <p class="abstract">Elementary algebra is the most basic form of algebra. It is taught to students who are presumed to have no knowledge of mathematics beyond the basic principles of arithmetic. In arithmetic, only numbers and their arithmetical operations (such as +, −, ×, ÷) occur. In algebra, numbers are often represented by symbols called variables (such as a, n, x, y or z). This is useful because:</p>
